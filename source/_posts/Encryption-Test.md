What is Hexo Blog Encrypt

Think about this, you write an article, but not want everyone to read. So you will add a passwrod on the blog, others need to answer the password to access the blog. It is easy on wordpress or emlog or other blog system. However, when you on hexo, there is no such a plugin or function before. Now let me introduce my plugin "Hexo-Blog-Encrypt".
Live Demo

See mhexo.github.io/example-site/2016/10/26/HexoBlogEncrpyt/, all passwords are mikemessi.

Install

npm install --save hexo-blog-encrypt

or yarn add hexo-blog-encrypt (require Yarn)

The plugin will use the template content instead of the default one.

Thanks
